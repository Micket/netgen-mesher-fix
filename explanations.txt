------------------- Core math ---------------------------

gprim   - Basic types and functions for vector math
linalg  - Basic types for linear algebra
general - Convenience functions. strings, sorting, memory allocation, hashtables, and more

------------------- Core meshing ------------------------
These libraries have cross dependencies. Unless componenets are carefully picked out of each module
they all have to be included in any library.

csg     - Computational surface geometry. Depends on linalg, meshing, geom2d
meshing - Creates meshes. Depends on csg, linalg, stlgeom
geom2d  - 2D functions. Depends on csg, linalg, meshing
stlgeom - STL functions. Depends on meshing, gprim, linalg, 

------------------- Optional ------------------------

interface     - Read/Write support for various file formats. Depends on occ
occ           - OpenCascade support
visualization - For visualization of the mesh
